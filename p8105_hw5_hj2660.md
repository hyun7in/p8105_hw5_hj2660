# Problem 1

Describe the raw data. Create a city_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore,
MD”) and then summarize within cities to obtain the total number of
homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those for which the
disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No arrest”).

``` r
homocide_df = read.csv("data-homicides-master/homicide-data.csv")
```
